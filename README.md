<p id="description">E-commerce App is a shopping website with electronic equipment like: mobile phones, laptops, headphones and smartwatches. The main navigation includes sections dedicated to one type of products, products on sale as well as the newest products. The website is useful to customers employees and admins. If you are a customer you can register your email and password or login if you have an account and do shopping in the traditional way. As an employee you can login and then you have additional options in the menu: you can edit product list e.g. add or remove products, change price description, etc. In addition, any employee can check order list here. If you are an admin you can carry out the same tasks as a customer and an employee but you can also change a role for a new registered person. The shopping website is designed for all screens (desktops, tablets and mobile phones) except for an additional option for an admin and an emloyee, which can only be displayed correctly on desktop screens.  </p>
